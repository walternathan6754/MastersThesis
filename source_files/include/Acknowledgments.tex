First, I would like to thank my family, my friends, and my roommates for always supporting me and listening to my complaints when I was stressed and tired.  I would also like to thank my lab mates Abhishek Jaiswal and Zhikun Cai for their useful discussions of results, for patiently teaching me when I first joined the group, and especially for helping me with codes and scripts.  

Most importantly, I would like to thank Professor Yang Zhang for his clairvoyant guidance, insightful mentoring, and patient help during this project.  He has been invaluable to this work as well as my development as a graduate student.  

Lastly, I would like to acknowledge the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for providing me with the fellowship that has funded me during the extent of this research.
